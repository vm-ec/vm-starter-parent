# vm-starter-parent
This project is a starter library designed to centralize and standardize common reusable components and cross-cutting concerns across multiple projects. Serving as a base (parent) module, it provides foundational building blocks that can be easily extended or integrated into other services. 

🚀 Key Features:
✅ Centralized Exception Handling – Consistent and structured error management across services

📋 Unified Logging Mechanism – Standardized logging setup for better observability and debugging

🔁 Generic Response Structure – Predefined response templates for uniform API output

🌐 Web Client Integration – Simplified and reusable client for calling third-party APIs

🧱 Modular and Extensible Design – Easily adoptable in microservices and monolithic architectures

This library helps in promoting code reusability, consistency, and faster onboarding for new services by reducing repetitive boilerplate code.
